      "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was thinking about functional components and performance enhancements.\r\nDoing some tests, I noticed that react re-render children provided by functional components again when parent updates, even when they just render a static JSX (don't receive props or use any value provided by a useState hook, for example, like `const Component = () => <h1>Hellow World!</h1>`).\r\nBut using a `React.memo` HOC (with or without a mocked `propsAreEquals` function as argument, like `() => true`) the behavior is the expect \"don't re-render\". Do this really necessary? I think React can jump this automatic, because the component don't have a trigger can change its final result.\r\nOr, am I not noticing something?\r\nIt is easy to replicate this test case, but I can provide a test repository if necessary.\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nI use devTools highlights to see render events."

I recommend merging this PR first before installing the GitHub App, to ensure that all future PRs will work from the get-go.\r\n\r\nThe gist of it is:\r\n\r\nThe goal of this app is to make it easier for you to test your library without publishing to npm yet. Since CodeSandbox is already used for bug reports we wanted to make it possible to also test the PR version of your library with the existing bug reports.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal flow, it would work like this:\r\n\r\n1. Someone opens an issue for a bug with a sandbox reproducible\r\n2. Someone opens a fix PR mentioning the issue\r\n3. We build the library from the PR, fork the sandbox repro and install the new library in that sandbox\r\nThis way you will only have to open the generated sandbox to confirm that the fix works. No need to clone, install or test locally."

      "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nThis is a question.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n`useLayoutEffect` does not always seem to complete operations before DOM paint.\r\nI use `useLayoutEffect` to apply certain styles to elements before they are painted to DOM. In particular, I am trying to reproduce the [FLIP](https://css-tricks.com/animating-layouts-with-the-flip-technique/) technique to make shuffling a list pretty. I store DOM coordinates for every list child in a `ref` object on first render, and on second render in `useLayoutEffect` I use those to compare with new coordinates and trigger an animation. To keep track of children I give them a `data-id` attribute.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nIn my demo I randomly shuffle items, but animations do not happen if I sort them back to their initial state, in which they are ordered.\r\n\r\nHere is the demo:\r\nhttps://flip.jlkiri.now.sh/\r\nOR\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/gallant-heyrovsky-dwdps\r\n\r\nHere is the code for the demo and the hook I use:\r\nhttps://github.com/jlkiri/react-easy-flip\r\nhttps://github.com/jlkiri/react-easy-flip/blob/master/src/hooks/useFlip.js\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that restoring the initial order should work just like shuffling, since DOM position for a particular child with a particular `data-id` changes. Is this a result of some hidden heuristics of the React renderer or a bug?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact: 16.10.2\r\nOS: Windows\r\nBrowsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge\r\nPrevious versions: Do not know about versions in which it works\r\n"

Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n1. Render a script tag with quotes on the server.\r\n2. Render a script tag with quotes on the client.\r\n3. Compare the output. \r\n\r\nNote that the quotes are html-encoded to `&quot`.\r\n\r\nThis CodeSandbox is a little rough but very simple: https://codesandbox.io/s/affectionate-star-xe8ym\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe script tag content is not html-encoded on either the server or the client.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n16.8.6\r\nI'm not sure when this was introduced."

It also works as expected on iOS Safari.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nClicking on "With preventDefault() on pointerdown": Should only trigger `pointerdown` and `click` events.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

This is not a problem in se because of the idempotent nature of `render()` (which has to be pure), but makes me think that this is an unneeded call because if an error has been thrown in `render()`, re-executing it right away would still lead to the same exception being thrown.\r\n\r\nOr, is there something I am missing? Maybe related to how React works internally and because of that it needs to recall `render()` as soon as that same `render()` has thrown...\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nOS: OS X\r\nBrowser: Chrome 77\r\nUsing the same React 16 development version of the Pen:\r\n\r\n`https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js`\r\n`https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js`\r\n\r\nThank you for the attention.\r\n"

      'Updates of like priority that occur within the same browser event are guaranteed to be batched. This is an important guarantee for event emitter or subscription-like patterns where a single browser event can spawn updates on many different components, all of which need to commit consistently.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we have a heuristic of marking the first "event time" of an update inside an event. Subsequent updates in the same event will reuse the same event time.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the event, the event time should be cleared. Failing to clear the event time has the effect of "freezing" the timeline, causing weird expiration quirks.\r\n\r\nThe event time used to be cleared right before entering the render phase. This mostly works, since every update will eventually be followed by a render task. However, it has some flaws: if there\'s lots of other non-React main thread work in the mean time, subsequent events could get overbatched. The heuristic is also a bit fragile; it happens to be the case that every call to `requestCurrentTime` is accompanied by a render task, but that may not necessarily always be the case, creating a subtle refactor hazard.\r\n\r\nInstead of relying on the next render task to reset the current event time, this change schedules a microtask.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t use an actual microtask because React does not currently require a Promise polyfill. Instead, I\'m using a Scheduler task at immediate priority, which has almost the same semantics. (There\'s even an open question of whether we should get rid of Scheduler\'s "immediate" priority in favor of microtasks, but since it currently exists in the browser proposal, too, we can figure that out later.)\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17159 for context on what prompted this PR'

      "Hello Facebook and React developers the whole world over:\r\n\r\nMy name is Scott. I've previously been involved in the modernization of PHP's cryptography features ([removing mcrypt](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral), [adding libsodium](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/libsodium)), which in turn led to HHVM implementing their own sodium extension.\r\n\r\nConsequently, if you're using PHP 7.2 (or newer), or HHVM 3.20 (or newer), support for libsodium is [baked into the programming language](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages) and you don't have to install anything extra. \r\n\r\n(Unless your operating system's packaging team is asleep at the wheel with PHP security. Let me know if you encounter that so I can hopefully help address these deficiencies in the ecosystem.)\r\n\r\nAs part of my security work, I've been exposed to an increasing number of React apps in recent months. I like the philosophy of React (especially **learn once, write everywhere**).\r\n\r\nMost of the time, the sheer fact that folks are developing in React instead of writing their own framework means I don't get to include client-side vulnerabilities (e.g. DOM-based XSS) in my reports. However, I *have* found a substantial number of cryptography-related issues in people's React apps. \r\n\r\nTo be clear: **That isn't React's fault at all.** It's a symptom of [the greater JavaScript ecosystem](https://twitter.com/CiPHPerCoder/status/1183282359862530049) and a general lack of easy-to-use, secure-by-default, and easily discovered cryptography libraries. (As the linked thread shows: AWS's libraries are almost certainly good, but at the time of that tweet, you wouldn't find them searching for \"encryption\" on NPM.)\r\n\r\nI would like to severely reduce the prevalence of trivial cryptography bugs in React projects. There are a couple of directions we can go with that goal in mind. I'm going to propose one below, but by no means is my idea the *only* solution. \r\n\r\n(If so desired, I can separate this into two separate Github issues: One for the problem, the other for my proposed solution. Please let me know if that's easier to digest.)\r\n\r\n## Proposal \r\n\r\n### Background and Prior Development\r\n\r\n[The state of JavaScript cryptography is pretty terrible](https://dev.to/paragonie/sodium-plus-a-positive-cryptography-experience-for-javascript-developers-2p08). Writing performant code with libsodium requires manually sizing your own buffers, etc. Writing cross-platform code requires writing code a completely different way. \r\n\r\nNot using libsodium is [perilous in other ways](https://github.com/danang-id/simple-crypto-js/issues/12), and has motivated other security companies to recommend developers [just \"use the NaCl/libsodium default\"](https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html) in most places where cryptography touches application code.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of [scrypt-for-humans](https://github.com/joepie91/scrypt-for-humans), I developed a cross-platform, permissively licensed, asynchronous JavaScript module called [**Sodium-Plus**](https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus).\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit as React, we want users to be able to learn Sodium-Plus once, and write code anywhere. It runs in Node.js and in a web browser, with a near-identical API and user experience. (The delta in the UX is the unavoidable difference between loading a module with `require` and including a script tag in the HTML.)\r\n\r\n> You can [read the documentation online](https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus/tree/master/docs).\r\n\r\nBy default, Sodium-Plus uses [libsodium.js](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js), which is the result of libsodium compiled into WebAssembly, which runs in the browser. However, if you install sodium-native alongside sodium-plus, it will *opportunistically* use sodium-native instead with no code changes.\r\n\r\n(Sodium-native is much faster than libsodium.js, but isn't browser-compatible.)\r\n\r\n### The Meat and Potatoes of the Proposal\r\n\r\nGiven the challenges of the JavaScript ecosystem, and the availability of usable cryptography, I'd like to recommend the inclusion of `sodium-plus` in a future release of React.\r\n\r\n* Users will have an identical user experience in a browser that they get in any Node.js environment (server, mobile, desktop, shell script, etc.).\r\n* A comparable API is already provided for HHVM users by Facebook.\r\n* PHP, which powers [roughly 4 out of 5 websites according to W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all), has already adopted a comparable API.\r\n\r\nReact doesn't currently provide a cryptography interface. If React ever does provide one, libsodium is almost certainly the best one to provide (prior to the maturity of post-quantum cryptography, of course). \r\n\r\nReact doesn't necessarily *have to* provide a cryptography interface, but React apps would be a lot safer if most developers had a stable, easy to use, misuse-resistant, cross-platform suite of cryptography tools at their disposal.\r\n\r\nOut of all the existing options for libsodium, ours is the only one that provides an async/await-ready API, works everywhere, and has the same API and developer experience where ever you encounter it (in the same spirit as React).\r\n\r\nI believe the arguments above make a strong case for sodium-plus as the best choice for the React community. If anyone has criticism to offer Sodium-Plus or my proposal in this Github issue, I welcome it. (If your criticism would be deemed off-topic for this discussion, `scott at paragonie dot com` goes directly to me.)"

      "I'm using Next.js `9.1.1` and React `16.10.2`. The Next app (in `src/app`) gets built into a `dist/` directory at the root of the project with the `package.json` file moved over and installed within it. This is necessary because the app, when deployed, runs inside of a Firebase function.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that if I have a built version laying around, React errors out about invalid use of hooks. If I empty `dist/` everything works well. So this *seems* to be because there's multiple Reacts. But the app doesn't look in `dist/` or anything, so not sure why it'd load React from there too. But, if it's not that, then idk what it is. I'm pretty sure the code itself isn't using hooks wrong, it's pretty small and straight-forward component:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst CurrentUser: React.FC = () => {\r\n  const [user, initialising, error] = useAuthState(firebase.auth());\r\n\r\n  const signIn = async () => {\r\n    await firebase.auth().signInWithPopup(new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider());\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const signOut = async () => {\r\n    await firebase.auth().signOut();\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  // start rendering things\r\n};\r\n```"

In particular, I am trying to reproduce the [FLIP](https://css-tricks.com/animating-layouts-with-the-flip-technique/) technique to make shuffling a list pretty. I store DOM coordinates for every list child in a `ref` object on first render, and on second render in `useLayoutEffect` I use those to compare with new coordinates and trigger an animation. To keep track of children I give them a `data-id` attribute.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nIn my demo I randomly shuffle items, but animations do not happen if I sort them back to their initial state, in which they are ordered.\r\n\r\nHere is the demo:\r\nhttps://flip.jlkiri.now.sh/\r\nOR\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/gallant-heyrovsky-dwdps\r\n\r\nHere is the code for the demo and the hook I use:\r\nhttps://github.com/jlkiri/react-easy-flip\r\nhttps://github.com/jlkiri/react-easy-flip/blob/master/src/hooks/useFlip.js\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that restoring the initial order should work just like shuffling, since DOM position for a particular child with a particular `data-id` changes. Is this a result of some hidden heuristics of the React renderer or a bug?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

This is not a problem in se because of the idempotent nature of `render()` (which has to be pure), but makes me think that this is an unneeded call because if an error has been thrown in `render()`, re-executing it right away would still lead to the same exception being thrown.\r\n\r\nOr, is there something I am missing? Maybe related to how React works internally and because of that it needs to recall `render()` as soon as that same `render()` has thrown...\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nOS: OS X\r\nBrowser: Chrome 77\r\nUsing the same React 16 development version of the Pen:\r\n\r\n`https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js`\r\n`https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js`\r\n\r\nThank you for the attention.\r\n",

I keep special information in that scene, which i need when constructing new objects.\r\n\r\nNow, when i use createPortal, like so:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction A() {\r\n  // Create virtual scene\r\n  const virtualScene = useMemo(() => new THREE.Scene(), [])\r\n\r\n  // Render elements into the virtual scene via createPortal\r\n  return createPortal(\r\n    <mesh onClick={() => console.log("clicked")}>\r\n      <meshNormalMaterial attach="material" />\r\n      <boxBufferGeometry attach="geometry" args={[10, 10, 10]} />\r\n    </mesh>\r\n    virtualScene,\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the createInstance inside the reconciler will receive the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\ncreateInstance(\r\n  type = "meshNormalMaterial",\r\n  props = { attach: "material" },\r\n  container = virtualScene,\r\n  hostContext = {},\r\n  internalInstanceHandle = { ... }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem that i face is that i also need to know the root instance into which the portal is rendered, but there seem to be no obvious means to get it. Digging around i noticed that the  internalInstanceHandle fibernode contains it when i traverse it:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst fn = (node: Reconciler.Fiber): THREE.Object3D => {\r\n  if (!node.return) return node.stateNode.containerInfo\r\n  else return fn(node.return)\r\n}\r\nlet scene = fn(internalInstanceHandle) // ---> the root scene\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that seems pretty sketchy. Is there any other way, or could it be exposed?',

        "Hello Facebook and React developers the whole world over:\r\n\r\nMy name is Scott. I've previously been involved in the modernization of PHP's cryptography features ([removing mcrypt](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral), [adding libsodium](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/libsodium)), which in turn led to HHVM implementing their own sodium extension.\r\n\r\nConsequently, if you're using PHP 7.2 (or newer), or HHVM 3.20 (or newer), support for libsodium is [baked into the programming language](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages) and you don't have to install anything extra. \r\n\r\n(Unless your operating system's packaging team is asleep at the wheel with PHP security. Let me know if you encounter that so I can hopefully help address these deficiencies in the ecosystem.)\r\n\r\nAs part of my security work, I've been exposed to an increasing number of React apps in recent months. I like the philosophy of React (especially **learn once, write everywhere**).\r\n\r\nMost of the time, the sheer fact that folks are developing in React instead of writing their own framework means I don't get to include client-side vulnerabilities (e.g. DOM-based XSS) in my reports. However, I *have* found a substantial number of cryptography-related issues in people's React apps. \r\n\r\nTo be clear: **That isn't React's fault at all.** It's a symptom of [the greater JavaScript ecosystem](https://twitter.com/CiPHPerCoder/status/1183282359862530049) and a general lack of easy-to-use, secure-by-default, and easily discovered cryptography libraries. (As the linked thread shows: AWS's libraries are almost certainly good, but at the time of that tweet, you wouldn't find them searching for \"encryption\" on NPM.)\r\n\r\nI would like to severely reduce the prevalence of trivial cryptography bugs in React projects. There are a couple of directions we can go with that goal in mind. I'm going to propose one below, but by no means is my idea the *only* solution. \r\n\r\n(If so desired, I can separate this into two separate Github issues: One for the problem, the other for my proposed solution. Please let me know if that's easier to digest.)\r\n\r\n## Proposal \r\n\r\n### Background and Prior Development\r\n\r\n[The state of JavaScript cryptography is pretty terrible](https://dev.to/paragonie/sodium-plus-a-positive-cryptography-experience-for-javascript-developers-2p08). Writing performant code with libsodium requires manually sizing your own buffers, etc. Writing cross-platform code requires writing code a completely different way. \r\n\r\nNot using libsodium is [perilous in other ways](https://github.com/danang-id/simple-crypto-js/issues/12), and has motivated other security companies to recommend developers [just \"use the NaCl/libsodium default\"](https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html) in most places where cryptography touches application code.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of [scrypt-for-humans](https://github.com/joepie91/scrypt-for-humans), I developed a cross-platform, permissively licensed, asynchronous JavaScript module called [**Sodium-Plus**](https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus).\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit as React, we want users to be able to learn Sodium-Plus once, and write code anywhere. It runs in Node.js and in a web browser, with a near-identical API and user experience. (The delta in the UX is the unavoidable difference between loading a module with `require` and including a script tag in the HTML.)\r\n\r\n> You can [read the documentation online](https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus/tree/master/docs).\r\n\r\nBy default, Sodium-Plus uses [libsodium.js](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js), which is the result of libsodium compiled into WebAssembly, which runs in the browser. However, if you install sodium-native alongside sodium-plus, it will *opportunistically* use sodium-native instead with no code changes.\r\n\r\n(Sodium-native is much faster than libsodium.js, but isn't browser-compatible.)\r\n\r\n### The Meat and Potatoes of the Proposal\r\n\r\nGiven the challenges of the JavaScript ecosystem, and the availability of usable cryptography, I'd like to recommend the inclusion of `sodium-plus` in a future release of React.\r\n\r\n* Users will have an identical user experience in a browser that they get in any Node.js environment (server, mobile, desktop, shell script, etc.).\r\n* A comparable API is already provided for HHVM users by Facebook.\r\n* PHP, which powers [roughly 4 out of 5 websites according to W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all), has already adopted a comparable API.\r\n\r\nReact doesn't currently provide a cryptography interface. If React ever does provide one, libsodium is almost certainly the best one to provide (prior to the maturity of post-quantum cryptography, of course). \r\n\r\nReact doesn't necessarily *have to* provide a cryptography interface, but React apps would be a lot safer if most developers had a stable, easy to use, misuse-resistant, cross-platform suite of cryptography tools at their disposal.\r\n\r\nOut of all the existing options for libsodium, ours is the only one that provides an async/await-ready API, works everywhere, and has the same API and developer experience where ever you encounter it (in the same spirit as React).\r\n\r\nI believe the arguments above make a strong case for sodium-plus as the best choice for the React community. If anyone has criticism to offer Sodium-Plus or my proposal in this Github issue, I welcome it. (If your criticism would be deemed off-topic for this discussion, `scott at paragonie dot com` goes directly to me.)",

This is necessary because the app, when deployed, runs inside of a Firebase function.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that if I have a built version laying around, React errors out about invalid use of hooks.
