This is not a problem in se because of the idempotent nature of `render()` (which has to be pure), but makes me think that this is an unneeded call because if an error has been thrown in `render()`, re-executing it right away would still lead to the same exception being thrown.\r\n\r\nOr, is there something I am missing? Maybe related to how React works internally and because of that it needs to recall `render()` as soon as that same `render()` has thrown...\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nOS: OS X\r\nBrowser: Chrome 77\r\nUsing the same React 16 development version of the Pen:\r\n\r\n`https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js`\r\n`https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js`\r\n\r\nThank you for the attention.\r\n"

        "body": "This is a problem i am facing with the [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/drcmda/react-three-fiber), a react renderer for threejs.  The following image is probably a good overview:\r\n\r\n![reconciler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2223602/67144414-59502c80-f276-11e9-89d1-97496ee10b8c.jpg)\r\n\r\nBasically i have a reconciler, it has a root instance, a scene in my case into which everything's rendered. I keep special information in that scene, which i need when constructing new objects.\r\n\r\nNow, when i use createPortal, like so:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction A() {\r\n  // Create virtual scene\r\n  const virtualScene = useMemo(() => new THREE.Scene(), [])\r\n\r\n  // Render elements into the virtual scene via createPortal\r\n  return createPortal(\r\n    <mesh onClick={() => console.log(\"clicked\")}>\r\n      <meshNormalMaterial attach=\"material\" />\r\n      <boxBufferGeometry attach=\"geometry\" args={[10, 10, 10]} />\r\n    </mesh>\r\n    virtualScene,\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the createInstance inside the reconciler will receive the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\ncreateInstance(\r\n  type = \"meshNormalMaterial\",\r\n  props = { attach: \"material\" },\r\n  container = virtualScene,\r\n  hostContext = {},\r\n  internalInstanceHandle = { ... }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem that i face is that i also need to know the root instance into which the portal is rendered, but there seem to be no obvious means to get it. Digging around i noticed that the  internalInstanceHandle fibernode contains it when i traverse it:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst fn = (node: Reconciler.Fiber): THREE.Object3D => {\r\n  if (!node.return) return node.stateNode.containerInfo\r\n  else return fn(node.return)\r\n}\r\nlet scene = fn(internalInstanceHandle) // ---> the root scene\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that seems pretty sketchy. Is there any other way, or could it be exposed?"

If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n9.

Clicking on button again, while the animation is running, should de-highlight the lines to original state. \r\n\r\nI use [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for doing animations.\r\n\r\nOn setting the timeline progress of animation to 0, all the values get reset, however, the last one modified continues to remain in same state. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce, click the button, and after a couple lines have highlighted, click the button again. \r\n\r\nCode Sandbox : https://codesandbox.io/s/inspiring-gates-poozb\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAll the variables would have been set to false on toggling the animation state. However, the last modified variable in the current animation remains in the same state.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nWorking with following dependencies: \r\n![Screenshot 2019-10-16 at 2 13 50 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5795958/66903064-61faf580-f01f-11e9-9863-48200839afea.png)\r\n\r\nDoesn't work as expected with following dependencies: \r\n![Screenshot 2019-10-16 at 2 13 23 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5795958/66903143-8c4cb300-f01f-11e9-9fd6-71ad763cb626.png)\r\n\r\nPlatform tested on : Mac OS Mojave with latest Chrome.\r\n\r\nI would like to understand what is causing this issue and steps I can take to make it work in the above mentioned version where it doesn't work. \r\n"

If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n9.
